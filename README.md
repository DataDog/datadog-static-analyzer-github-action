# Datadog Static Analyzer Github Action

## Overview

Run a [Datadog Static Analysis][1] job in your GitHub Action workflows.

## Setup

To use Datadog Static Analysis, you need to add a `static-analysis.datadog.yml` file to your repository's root directory to specify which rulesets to use.

```yaml
rulesets:
  - <ruleset-name>
  - <ruleset-name>
```

### Example for Python

You can see an example for Python-based repositories:

```yaml
rulesets:
  - python-code-style
  - python-best-practices
  - python-inclusive
```

## Workflow

Create a file in `.github/workflows` to run a Datadog Static Analysis job.

The following is a sample workflow file.

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  check-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Datadog Static Analyzer
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check code meets quality standards
        id: datadog-static-analysis
        uses: DataDog/datadog-static-analyzer-github-action@v1
        with:
          dd_app_key: ${{ secrets.DD_APP_KEY }}
          dd_api_key: ${{ secrets.DD_API_KEY }}
          dd_service: "my-service"
          dd_env: "ci"
          dd_site: {{< region-param key="dd_site" code="true" >}}
          cpu_count: 2
          enable_performance_statistics: false
```

You **must** set your Datadog API and application keys as [secrets in your GitHub repository][4] whether at the organization or repository level. For more information, see [API and Application Keys][2].
